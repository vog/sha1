* SHA-1 implementation in C++

** Warning

Do not use SHA-1 unless you have to! Although SHA-1 is not as broken as SHA-0 and MD5, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1#The_SHAppening][SHA-1 is generally considered weak]]. Use a hash function from the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2][SHA-2]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2][SHA-3]] family instead.
